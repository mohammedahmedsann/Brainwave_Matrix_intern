Car Sales Data Analysis
This project showcases the work I completed during my internship, focusing on analyzing car sales data to extract meaningful insights. Using Python, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualized sales trends, and created an interactive dashboard to explore:

Gender-wise revenue contribution and sales distribution
Seasonal sales trends (monthly)
Revenue and distribution by dealer region
